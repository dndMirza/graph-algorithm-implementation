# graph-algorithm-implementation
Developed and implemented several graph algorithms to analyse graph properties and solve common problems.

## Description:
Implemented functions to calculate total edge weight and determine the number of connected components within a graph (e.g., using BFS/DFS traversal).

Created a utility to generate random graphs based on specified node/edge counts and edge probability.

## Features:
Implemented an algorithm (e.g., Prim's or Kruskal's) to compute the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted graph, demonstrating understanding of greedy algorithms.

## Technologies:
Java, Graph Theory, Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's/Kruskal's Algorithm), BFS/DFS, Data Structures
